He loved Erlang, but he missed some features, so he decided to create a new programming language which wil run on Erlang VM (BEAM), with all the benefits of Erlang and BEAM but a better syntax and ecosystem.\n\n\nOn Jan 9, 2011 Jos\u00e9 Valim initialized a new git repository for this language and called it Elixir.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the language\n|\n\n\nElixir is a functional, dynamic language designed for easier scalability and maintainability. It runs on Erlang VM which is refined and battle tested for decades. Scalability, concurrency, fault-tolernace and hot code reloading are some of the strengths of the Erlang VM (BEAM).\n\n\nElixir makes creating and scaling web applications a pleasant experience. Elixir and its full-stack framework Phoenix are heaven for Rails, Django, Laravel, Symfony, Play, Spring, Mojolicious and Grails developers, looking for a technology as productive as their previous language/framework but a lot easier to scale vertically and horizontally.\n\n\nTo learn more about Elixir's strengths and features, go to \nElixir's homepage\n.",
